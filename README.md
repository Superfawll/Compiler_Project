Compiler's Fucking Project

****************** NOTE! ******************

Files are tagged to become easier to classify!

Green tagged files are pure compiler codes that build up the main thing

Blue tagged files are standard testing inputs , like the code, tokens and stuff

Red tagged files are for partial testing, like wrong token stream for panic mode

Purple files are grammar related input files, like the parsing table, follow sets, JFLAP's .jff outfile, and the grammar itself!

and eventually, Yellow files are outputs, like parse tree, token stream and reduction series!

****************** NOTE! ******************

Feel free to add any notes you find necessary to this file so that we dont fuck up =))
